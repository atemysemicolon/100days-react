# 100days-react
This is my repository for the #100 days of coding. I created this on day 1. This will be my react sandbox, probably. 


* I'm going to document my progress over here. I have not thought about what I will be doing over the next few months - I only have a vague idea. But, I have decided to start with React. Go with the flow and see where it leads.

If you have some ideas to share, or just want to start a conversation, open up an issue!

## Worklog

- Day 1+2
    + Done the React basics tutorial
    + Perhaps make this into a 8x8, 5 player game
